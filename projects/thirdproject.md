<h1>Stimulation via simulation</h1>

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/thirdproject/bee-on-sunflower.jpg">

<p>From the simple implementation of a pseudo table-tennis-like game to the predictive software that monitors and attempts to forecast the weather, we use simulations every day and more often than we might realize.  Even within ourselves we utilize a type of simulation in our imaginations which allows us to picture a future state and organize a plan to achieve that, like choosing what path to take to reach a certain place.  The possession of an accurate simulation is perhaps one of the most essential elements of any type of human progress and human planning but we humans take a peculiar interest in applying simulations to our recreational activities merely out of intuition.</p>
  
<p>When we see an object rise, relative to our perception, we might understandably expect it to respect gravity and fall, especially when we are not explicitly told to suspend our disbelief or when we are not made aware of the circumstances which might change those perceptions and resultant expectations; like if the game or image in-question was set or captured in "space."  In these cases, we pursue the more accurate simulation to encourage a sense of immersion, or the ability to successfully insert your perception believably into that illusion, if only at least while you're participating with or viewing it.</p>
  
<p>This impulse and aesthetic preference was encouraged in me by Khan Academy's course focusing on simulation.  One of the first projects is to create a static image of a mountain range drawn using a noise function, also called perlin noise named for it's creator.  In the subsequent section's project we are instructed to design a simulation of an actual dynamic creature.</p>
