  <p>JavaScript has an interesting place in the collection of programming languages and uses a simpler lexicon of keywords that grants a level of accessibility for new users and an unmatchable amount, in my opinion, for complete beginners.  The introduction of 'let' and 'const' as new keywords for declaring less ambiguous variables also allows a level of control for more advanced writers over the behavior of their programs without sacrificing the simplicity inherent in its "weakly typed" variables.  In other words, a strongly typed variable is merely a named piece of data that can be made to represent a number or a letter or a collection of data, called arrays, or even can represent another named piece of data, all without having to explicitly designate what type of data it is.  This is a double-edged sword, however, that can provide flexibility as well as it can cause unforseen interactions if a query receives certain unexpected values from them.  What is a program supposed to do with the word "Apple" if it's expecting a value like 42 or some complex object containing an assortment of data?</p>

  <p>The benefits of using JavaScript, therefor, should be correlated with and accentuated in environments where there is an emphasis on the rapid production and implementation of shorter lengths of working code.  Where, for example, very simple programs can end up with more lines of boiler-plate code than it contains ones that are relevant to the task at hand, which can lead to these procedures consuming the majority of the time that it takes to produce that program.  It is in these situations that the simple choice of language can become the deciding factor between being efficiently productive, or not.  Synergistically, the relative ease with which it is to learn the language, or the speed with which one is expected to be able to use and understand it, should make this language <em>much</em> more appealing to businesses and thematically fits within that context.  That being said, the power inherent in its flexibility is one of the reasons I would prefer to work with this language.</p>

  <p>The idea of "Athletic Software Engineering", which values the very repetition <em>along with</em> the capability for rapidity in development and deployment, portray parallel themes to the strength of JavaScript.  The approach is definitely a novelty for me, since I haven't had any timed exercizes as part of the curriculum of any practical programming classes, and upon completion of two of these practice exercizes, called Work-Outs-of-the-Day (WOD's), I am filled with a sense of dread and disdain.  It seems I will consistently go over-time in these timed exercizes to the disappointing result of "Did-Not-Finish", if these results prove predictive and consistent, because it was taking me a while to even frame the solutions to these relatively simple problems in my head.  I should, however, temper my self-expectation with the knowledge that the practice WOD I completed in class was much simpler, and I completed it well within the prescribed time.  I will, then, give the benefit-of-the-doubt to my instructor that this particular skill is useful, especially when it merely builds on what knowledge I've already proved I possess.</p>
