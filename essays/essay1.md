  <p>JavaScript has an interesting place in the collection of programming languages and uses a simpler lexicon of keywords that grants a level of accessibility for new users and an unmatchable amount, in my opinion, for complete beginners.  The introduction of 'let' and 'const' as new keywords for declaring less ambiguous variables allows a level of control for more advanced writers over the behavior of their programs without sacrificing the simplicity inherent in its dynamically typed variables.  In other words, a named piece of data can be made to represent a number or a letter or a collection of data or even can represent another named piece of data, all without having to explicitly designate what type of data it is.  This is a double-edged sword, however, that can provide flexibility as well as it can cause unforseen interactions if functions or objects receive unexpected values from them.  What is a program supposed to do with the word "Apple" if it's expecting a value like 24 or some complex object?</p>

  <p>The benefits of using JavaScript, therefor, should be correlated with and accentuated in environments where there is an emphasis on the rapid production and implementation of shorter lengths of working code.  Where, for example, very simple programs can end up with more lines of boiler-plate code than it does that is relevant to the task can become so time-consuming to produce that retyping repetetive things, like the lines of includes or intializing stdio elements in c, represents most of the time spent to write the file.  It is in these situations that the simple choice of language can become the deciding factor between being efficiently productive, or not.  Synergistically, the relative ease with which it is to learn the language, or the speed with which one is expected to be able to use and understand it, should make this language <em>much</em> more appealing to businesses and thematically fits within that context.</p>

  <p>In that same context is the idea of Academic Athleticism which values the very repetition itself along with the capability for rapidity in development and deployment.  The approach, however, is a novelty for me since I haven't had any timed exercizes as part of the curriculum of any practical programming class and upon completion of two practice of these exercizes, called Work-Outs-of-the-Day (WOD's), I am filled with a sense of dread and disdain.  It seems I will consistently go over-time into the territory of "Did-Not-Finish", if these results prove predictive, because it is taking me a while to even frame the solutions in my head.  Again, this stands in stark contrast to all other ICS courses to this point, and feels antithetical because it favors quick implementation of inferior algorithms for the sake of beating a clock.  The inelegance of these exercizes are, in my opinion, necessarily reflected in the forms of the solutions themselves, but I ain't got any better ideas for teaching things I don't know I'll need.</p>
