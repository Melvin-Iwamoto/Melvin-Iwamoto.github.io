  <h2>The creation of a problem</h2>
  <p>When we begin our journey in creating programs we are taught to comment our commands and even our variables with our intentions, especially when our variable names are ambiguous or are very short.  In practice, however, when the program isn't functioning as intended we have the impulse to change things around or add things to the program until we can get it to work.  Too often, for me at least, these 'basics' become seemingly tedious because the very contexts for each command and variable are ever-changing.  Having the discipline to stick to the program, no pun intended, when it comes to much more complex ideas about even the grammatical form--as opposed to merely commenting our syntax--can seem even more tedious and even pointless.  It is only when we return to our code, or inspect code produced by another, that we feel that need for the convention to spare us from confusion.</p>

  <h2>Standard Definition</h2>
  <p>Using something which automates and warns us of code that doesn't conform to a specified standard takes out much of the thought of it, for me, and allows a level of ease-of-use that makes <em>not</em> using it seem even lazier than doing so.  This experience, afforded to me by using Intellij IDEA with ESLint, was so profound and simple that it solidified the need, in my opinion, for easily applied standards.  You could read a play by Shakespeare that contains no spaces but it would take <em>significantly</em> longer to read and comprehend, and the production of that kind of document might understandably cause the author to resemble the appearance of a sadist in the eyes of their audience; not allowing some other reader, even yourself as the author, the common standards of legibility is disrespectful to that readers time.</p>

  <h2>My inability to talk to myself</h2>
  <p>Personally, even reading my own work can be hard to do and can be even harder to understand; in some cases my own intentions are nearly impossible to grasp so that any sort of modular development--perhaps an extension of that program output or an expansion in its very functionality--is equally impossible.  Years ago, I could have produced code that would, at least in certain cases, be implicitly understood with regard to its usage or intention and all of it with next to no added effort had I known about using Intellij with ESLint.  Whoever came up with the automated code-fixing that Intellij with ESLint provides should be given some sort of Nobel Peace Prize for service to sentience.</p>
