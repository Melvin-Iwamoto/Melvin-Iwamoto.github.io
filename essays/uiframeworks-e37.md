## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap 5 is a package which allows the designer of a website to create dynamically sized and stylized web pages.  The package consists of a variety of template-settings for types of sections that are commonly and frequently found on pages, like the now-common navigation bars at the tops of pages or drop-down menus and their associated buttons.  It also gives incredible support for common icons, like the triple line that represents most menu buttons or the icons for social media websites and applications that links you to either a specific profile associated with that website or to attach your own profile into the web site.

## Why is Bootstrap?

The complexity of using Bootstrap is significant, because you need to know what data these templates require and how and when to give it to them and sometimes even how they interact with each other.  The long list of supported objects--called classes--makes it a daunting prospect, and I've only shallowly interacted with it so far, but from what I've experienced it has been far easier to use *it* than to try to create these things myself; it invokes a satisfying not-"reinventing the wheel"-vibe when it actually all works out.
