## Engineering an engineer
For those of us not acquainted with Arthurian legend, the holy grail--according to https://www.merriam-webster.com website--can be "an object or goal that is sought after for its great significance".  With respect to software engineering skills, the quest for the holy grail can be embodied in the pursuit to become a _full-stack_ developer.  A full-stack developer is one who is capable of producing both the _front-end_ and _back-end_ of an application.

The front-end refers to that part of the app that the user would see and interact with, and is interchangeably referred to as the "client-side" in a website context.  The back-end refers to the parts that the user doesn't see, and is interchangeably referred to as the "server-side".  A developer can specialize in either, and it seems that many pursue at least a shallow understanding of both, but each person understandably tends toward either one of them according to their strength or experience.

So my use of the holy grail resembles a utopian ideal, practically, and when used improperly can obfuscate the reality into something comical.  This funny meme illustrates this point should I make that claim.

Now, aside from the fact that my implication of being a back-end developer, let alone a full-stack one, is too much of an overstatement; having something simple at the front to at least complete a relatively detailed back-portion is preferable to leaving it blank or getting it completely wrong, in my opinion, and is worth pursuing.  The quest goes ever-onward.

### The right tool(s) for the job

Producing anything presents obvious conundrums; what to do and how to go about it.  An easy, quick, and powerful alternative that we've been introduced to--rather than to design and build these up ourselves "from scratch"--is to learn how to use _Frameworks_.  These simply are sets of pre-made tools and resources that help us to accomplish the tasks of building either the front or back end--or in the case of some, both--of an application and have already laid down most, if not all, of the foundational work to implement itself.

There are several options--in many programming languages--to choose from to suit several different applications but the ones we worked with were created to use HTML, CSS, and javascript to make webpages.

### _Framing_ the conversation

Frameworks are classified based on which part of the application it is relevant to; so there are front-end frameworks and back-end frameworks.  One such framework concerns itself with the front end of webpages and is called _Bootstrap5_ and contains pre-made default HTML and CSS combinations, that are commonly used together for specific purposes, that can be used concisely like an abbreviation, and are called _components_.  On the other hand, _MongoDB_ is a back-end framework which implements the _design pattern_--the general form that a commonly desired functionality takes--of structured data storage for client and server databases, and is written in many programming languages.

#### Their powers combined

A third type of framework correlates to the combination of both the front and back end and is intuitively named a full-stack framework.  A powerful example of this is called _React_ which combines HTML, CSS, and significantly complex javascript, all into a new type of multi-lingual file.  The full-stack frameworks can also be composed of different frameworks; adding Bootstrap to React expands both into a new React-Bootstrap framework which allows easy Bootstrap styling through it's components with Reacts complex back-end functionality.

Some of these composite frameworks come with "packages" which include even more commonly implemented functionality; the Uniforms-bootstrap5 package satisfies the React-Bootstrap apps common need of retrieving information from forms on webpages and ensuring that that data is valid.  For example, when you sign in to your account on a site or when you enter your payment information to make purchases online, you are interacting with a special type of component that may have come from Uniforms-bootstrap5, or some other similar package, to ensure you make your password 8 characters long along with certain other requirements.

### To whom it may concern

The largest benefit of finding these composite frameworks with support for large amounts of packages is, of course, not having to do much of the work of making each of it's parts function together.  We refer to this type of monotonous writing as boilerplate code because of how the shape of implementing them seems to look identical from project to project when these projects consist of the same parts.  The kinder people of the community save these boilerplate files when they spot the pattern and provide them to the rest of us to use and improve on.

We do this, ourselves, all the time when we find we're using certain groups of words over and over again in the same way; as with writing the same "Happy New Years, Person-Y" or reprinting job resumes that barely change each time you need to use it.  We tend to recognize that pattern and save the generic form in a place that we can copy from and re-use the time already devoted to creating one of them.  In programming, as in any document generation, we call these repeating forms of boilerplate as _Templates_.

### Is this culture?

The amount of saved time, naturally, of using templates becomes much more pronounced when dealing with projects with increasing numbers of parts, or when dealing with significantly differing constituent parts; as would be the case when manually compiling full-stack frameworks from front and back end frameworks individually.  

There are also "packages" which extend frameworks with commonly desired functionality, like how the Uniforms-bootstrap5 package implements the commonly used functionality in a React-Bootstrap app of filling out forms on webpages.  For example, when you sign in to your account on a site or when you enter your payment information to make purchases online; these are done in "forms" that the Uniforms-bootstrap5 package has made general solutions for which can be utilized to quickly make them.

Some of the most powerful frameworks, however, are those which support the parallel development of both the front and back ends, which combine their respective frameworks and have done the work of implementing the interactions between them.  These types of frameworks are called, intuitively, full-stack frameworks and exist in many programming languages.  React itself is a full-stack framework because of how the javascript in it is run "under-the-hood" on the server-side, but it doesn't necessarily implement efficient large-scale databases "out-of-the-box".
