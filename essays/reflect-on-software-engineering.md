## The quest for the holy grail
For those of us not acquainted with Arthurian legend, the holy grail--according to https://www.merriam-webster.com website--can be "an object or goal that is sought after for its great significance".  With respect to software engineering skills, the quest for the holy grail can be represented in the pursuit to become a _full-stack_ developer.  A full-stack developer is one who is capable of producing both the _front-end_ and _back-end_ of an app; where the front-end refers to that part of the app that the user would see and interact with while the back-end refers to the parts that the user doesn't see.  A developer can specialize in either, and many pursue or require at least a shallow understanding of both, but each person tends toward one of them according to their strength.

In-practice, the holy grail is somewhat of a utopian ideal and can result in a reality for which only a humorous tone can properly portray, as the nice gentlemen from Monty Python has shown us.  The following picture is representative of my self-perception should I happen to claim to be a full-stack developer.

### _Framing_ the conversation

Producing either part of an application presents a couple common and daunting conundrums; How to structure the interaction between either "end" and the person or application using it, or even which language to write it in and how it's written.  An easy, quick, and powerful solution that we've been introduced to--rather than to build these up ourselves "from scratch"--is to learn how to use _Frameworks_; which simply are tools that help us to accomplish the tasks of building the front or back end--or in the case of some, both--of an application and have laid down most of the foundational work to implement its intended part.

There are several options to choose from, and in different programming languages, but the ones we were introduced to were written for and were utilized by us in javascript.

### The right tool(s) for the job

The many different options correlate with which part of the application it is intended to facilitate the production of; so there are front-end frameworks and back-end frameworks.  Furthermore, you can combine many different frameworks and use them all together; A framework to facilitate the creation of HTML documents, which
