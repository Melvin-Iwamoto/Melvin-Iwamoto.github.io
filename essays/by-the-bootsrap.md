## Lost in translation

Language is a powerful tool for accurately and concisely *symbolising* and *sharing* ideas.

*Written* language extends the possible scope of a language's utility *immeasurably*--temporally and spatially--and is perhaps the most important invention in all of human history.

Every language and alphabet can have wildly different *grammars*--patterns and structures of letters, words, and sentences--that must be followed, *to the letter*, to glean or convey anything meaningful.

*"Car driving person"* or *"mouse chased cat"*, depending on the motifs of the grammar, can have implications *differing* from a self-driving car or a monstrous rodent.

### *So* sorry.

Often *tone* or *contextual purpose* is the primary factor in trying to understand what *actually* was meant from any given message, but it can be challenging to communicate without some *conventions*, or agreed patterns, to represent them.

Formatting can serve to impart the intended subtext on, or include additional context to, the overlying message through *emphasis* or **highlighting** on ***words and Letters***.

Hyper-Text Markup Language [HTML][^html], Cascading Style Sheets ~~Language~~ [CSS][^css], and JavaScript [JS][^javascript] are the languages for the **content** and **formatting** and **functions**, respectively, of the documents that *browsers* use to communicate with *pages*.

#### Elemenopee

HTML ***elements***--which are the *types* of sections of a page, called tags--and CSS ***classes***--group-settings like sizes with colors--make up the *alphabet and punctuation* of the *language of the internet*.

```html
<div class="properties" id="division-element">
  <img src="www.image-element.com/picture.jpg" />
  <p id="paragraph-element">Text about above.</p>
</div>
```

### Sound it out
Learning how to spell words can be painful ~~and seem spiteful~~ but, in programming, as long as reading it produces the correct-enough sounds it doesn't matter *how* you ***spehl*** it.

In natural language, when introduced to new words you *could* deduce the correct *spelling* if you were already familiar with the culture, and *grammar*, that the word was from.

This is because there exists a common *vocabulary* of words that already symbolize many common *sounds* of the language into it's *typically* written forms.

The grammar normally has different rules for speaking and writing *types* of words depending on how those words are *used* or to modify what it *means*.

Typical **Verb** Forms:
- Base: **Spell**
- Spell***ing***
- Spell***ed***
- ~~Spell***unking***~~

For some reason there are people who catalog the "correct" spellings--ie. colo~~u~~r--of words, and all of their derivative forms, into horrible--logically-ordered--lists that are *hundreds* of pages long called dictionaries.
