## Lost in translation

Language is a powerful tool for accurately and concisely *symbolising* and *sharing* ideas.

*Written* language extends the possible scope of a language's utility *immeasurably*--temporally and spatially--and is perhaps the most important invention in all of human history.

Every language and alphabet can have wildly different *grammars*--patterns and structures of letters, words, and sentences--that must be followed, *to the letter*, to glean or convey anything meaningful.

"Car driving person" or "mouse chased cat", depending on the motifs of the grammar, can have implications *differing* from a self-driving car or a monstrous rodent.

### *So* sorry.

Often *tone* or *contextual purpose* is the primary factor when trying to understand what was *actually* being meant from any given message.

Formatting can serve to impart the intended tone or context of the underlying message through conventions for *emphasis* or **highlighting** on ***words*** to convey these various artistic, *implicit*, and **distinct** concepts.

Hyper-Text Markup Language [HTML][^html], Cascading Style Sheets ~~Language~~ [CSS][^css], and JavaScript [JS][^javascript] are the languages for the **content** and **formatting** and **functions**, respectively, of the documents that *browsers* use to communicate with website *pages*.

```html
<div class="properties" id="division-element">
  <img src="www.image-element.com/picture.jpg" />
  <p id="paragraph-element">Text about above.</p>
</div>
```

HTML ***elements***--which are the *types* of sections of a page, called tags--and CSS ***classes***--group-settings like sizes with colors--make up the *alphabet and punctuation* of the *language of the internet*.
