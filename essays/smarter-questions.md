  <p>We begin our lives from a standpoint of ignorance--filled with a void of knowledge--pursuing our answers with a voracity that rivals the hungriest wild animals.  Groping through the dark, we seek to purchase the unknown through brutally forced sheer determination.  For those of us who are fortunate enough to be nurtured in a household that rewards or encourages critical thought, perhaps those such that the renowned physicist Richard Feynman professed to grow up in, we can appreciate the opportunity for early growth that this environment provides proof of.  For those of us who were raised more significantly by secondary non-parent figures, however, and in an atmosphere oriented toward complete safety, for a collective, for the sake of simplicity--an environment which encourages not questioning authority figures--an individual can become scared of even asking questions because asking the primordial question of "why" is observably taken as the eleventh deadly sin and as antithetical to efficient security.  Although there can be no causation drawn from this flimsily outlined correlation, tanatamount to filler, we all seem to have heard the aphorism "There are no stupid questions" by our brave primary instructors who try to coax involvement out of the children of the future generations.</p>

  <p>With the ascension to a higher education, a painfully reiterated secondary and optional one, we are now confronted with the horrific revelation that perhaps there <em>are</em> stupid questions, and is even regularly used as a joke in the period of initial orientation during the first scheduled class-times for introductory college courses.  These jokes help only to coerce a laugh from financially obligated customers, however, and do not facilitate the spirit of the institution itself.  Indeed, upon cursory reflection, it is much more productive, for the students, to identify and articulate for them what can constitute a <em>smart</em> question, and perhaps smarter ways to ask them.</p>

  <p>Exemplary of this concept is my own question to StackOverflow.  A good question has, at least, enough information in it to identify the problem, and a bad question at the very least does not have enough information, and I somehow ironically accomplished both with my precociously pursued experiment in the C++ language.  I asked simple question regarding a bug in my code that, when run, seemed to freeze up and not respond.  I posted enough of my work such that the person who replied to me was unable to identify the problem directly, and had suggested investigating other unclearly referenced parts of it.  Upon investigation, and some very basic debugging, I was able to identify my silly mistake and learned the valuable lesson of not only asking a question the smart way but also in approaching questions that boil down to similar oversights.  Asking questions and gaining meaningful answers for future direction is a powerful procedure and a very simple one to exercize, but the question ought to be clear, concise, and contain <em>all</em> relevant information.</p>
